# Musuem-Project-
Online Museum Gateway System  Using SDLC Methodology
# Abstract 
This project aims to develop a comprehensive Online Museum Gateway System to 
address the operational challenges currently faced by museums, such as congestion, 
long queues, and inefficient ticket booking management. The project utilizes the 
System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) methodology, ensuring a comprehensive 
and structured coverage of all development stages, from requirements analysis to 
detailed design. The system is characterized as a Client-Server and Transaction 
Processing application , providing essential functions including user management, 
exhibition management, booking, and financial transactions. The report covers the 
investigation, analysis, and design phases, presenting functional and non-functional 
system requirements, the database ERD, and user interface prototypes (UI 
Mockups), establishing a solid foundation for the final implementation phase.
